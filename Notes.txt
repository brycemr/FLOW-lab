The wind rose data has a large effect on the final layout. Even just the number of discrete directions. This makes sense as it will only
look for wake interference in those directions.

Modify the depth functions to make it easier to understand the result.

The mean depth appears to affect the layout variance more than the difference in depth (For Linear Layout)


Possible Plots:
For 1D Linear and 1D Gaussian
Mean Depth vs Mean Distance Diff (Const Variance as % and Const Variance as number)
Variance (plotted as percent of mean depth) vs Mean Dist Diff (Const Mean Depth, try different kinds)

For 1D Combined


For 2D
