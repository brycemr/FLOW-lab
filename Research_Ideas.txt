Follow a similar procedure to that in 'Optimization of Wind Turbine Interconnections in an Offshore Wind Farm Using Metaheuristic Algorithms',
but add more constraints, and improved cost models. Could also experiment with using different Metaheuristic Algorithms to improve runtime
or supported number of turbines.

Work on the obstacles/no turbine zones problem. (Maybe have a growing space where turbines cannot be placed, slowly moving the turbines 
on either side). This could also apply to the fly through zone, you create a x-width no turbine zone that goes through entire area. Test this 
in 180 degrees. (Need to know more about that constraint, is there already a specified path, or does there just need to be one through the middle,
could it be through just a corner?)

Look at just substation optimization or just cable topology optimization using a number of different Metaheuristic algorithms to compare runtime

Build functions that work with my optimizer for other foundations that can be specified (twisted jacket, gravity, floating).

QUESTIONS FOR JAMES || DR NING
Should I be prepping my code to add it to FLOW FARM? 
Should I be preparing a paper?
Who are the stakeholders of my work?
